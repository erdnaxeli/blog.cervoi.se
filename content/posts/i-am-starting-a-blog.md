Yep.

I am Alexandre Morignot, also known as erdnaxeli over the internet.
I am a french dev currently doing Python web dev for a living, but IÂ also like doing [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) projects in my own time.

This blog probably will be mostly about my dev experiences and projects, but maybe more, who knows?

You can see me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@erdnaxeli:matrix.org), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/erdnaxeli), or [GitHub](https://github.com/erdnaxeli).
